## BTB-WorldMaker

The beyond the breach world maker generates continent maps that describe a 2-grid of terrain. This is also used to generate a 2d-map image. Both ther terrain description and the map image can be used by the world manager or the beyond the breach game in order to update and display the surrounding world.

There is a natural map which is static and a civilization map that is placed on top which is dynamic. The civilization map contains information such as population and tile infrastructure, while the natural map contains terrain information and natural resources.
